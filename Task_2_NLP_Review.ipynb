However, there are situations when we need to estimate the likelihood of a data instance belonging to each class label. It can assist us assess how decisive a classification model is and grasp how'sure' a model is when predicting a class label.The ideal calibrated model's curve is a linear straight line traveling linearly from (0, 0).\n",
    "- Tailored scoring rules: The key notion is that getting a higher score than your benchmark isn't enough (market). You must outperform it by a comfortable margin that allows you to benefit. To put it another way, we're comparing model forecasts to those of bookies.\n",
