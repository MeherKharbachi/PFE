    "<br>The very first generation of football-related models focused on the distribution of the number of goals scored during a football game.\n",
    "<br>Starting by <cite id=\"3v4le\"><a href=\"#zotero|11983139/Y23ZDDQG\">(Maher, 1982)</a></cite> included a general model that uses an independent poisson distribution to approximate a team's scoring frequency. However, this model assumes that each team's home, away, attack, and defense parameters are constant.\n",
    "<br> <cite id=\"0tzsj\"><a href=\"#zotero|11983139/C7ER7JJY\">(Dixon &#38; Coles, 1997)</a></cite> claimed in their paper that the previous model has certain limitations, such as low score results (0-0, 1-0, 0-1, and 1-1) being inherently unreported and each team's scoring and defending abilities being regarded as constant over time.\n",
    "<br>They proposed a new model with some specific enhancements. This model is a <b>bivariate poisson distribution</b> with parameters based on past performance for the number of goals scored by each team. This implies that recent matches have a greater impact on strength estimates.\n",
    "<br>Unlike previous models that used a <b>Poisson distribution</b>, <cite id=\"57q3t\"><a href=\"#zotero|11983139/RPMV87I5\">(Boshnakov et al., 2017)</a></cite> proposed a new approach that uses an independent and identically distributed <b>Weibull distribution</b> for the number of goals scored by the home and away teams in a match. Furthermore, they allowed for dependence between the goals scored by the two teams by using a copula to generate a bivariate distribution with positive or negative dependence.\n",
    "They compared this <b>bivariate Weibull</b> model to the others and discovered that it provides a good fit to <b>English Premier League</b> data from 2006/2007 to 2015/2016 seasons and achieves positive betting returns."

    "To date, <b>probabilistic methods</b> have yielded limited results and appear to have reached a plateau in terms of accuracy because team performance is dependent not only on team abilities but also on a variety of dynamic factors such as team configurations, player health, match location, weather, team strategies, and other external factors.\n",
    "As a result predicting football match outcomes becomes a very complex computational problem.\n",
    "<br>Among the <b>machine learning</b> methods interested in football match predictions, we highlight <b>sentimental analysis</b> of social media platforms. These studies focus on opinion aggregation and underscore the importance of hidden information contained in the sentiment of fans publications.\n",
    "<br> True, fans tweets are unlikely to influence game outcomes, unless they are used to exceptionally motivate or demotivate a team. For example, supporters use social media platforms like <b>Twitter</b> to express their personal feelings, primarily about the team they are following and their next opponent's strengths, weaknesses, and prospects, and this can sometimes help establish betting odds.\n",
    "<br>This method is used by <cite id=\"ua7k3\"><a href=\"#zotero|11983139/YREYVCH5\">(Schumaker et al., 2016)</a></cite> to predict <b>English Premier League</b> matches by analyzing fans tweets during the final three months of the 2013–2014 from February 16 through May 11 2014. It achieved an accuracy of 50%,this system has only two possible outcomes: home team win or away team win. If the model's number of Home or Away tweets was zero, the match was not considered for that model. However, it was discovered that sentiment was unable to recognize a draw outcome, so this category was dropped.\n",

    "<br>The findings will be compared to traditional and machine learning approaches described in the literature, and the following questions will be addressed: <br><b>Do football experts' human analysis influence the predictions of football matches?</b><br><b>Can this new model outperform the predictions of the bookmakers?</b>"

Machine learning is being used in virtually all areas in one way or another, due to its extreme effectiveness. One such area where predictive systems have gained a lot of popularity is the prediction of football match results. This paper demonstrates our work on the building of a generalized predictive model for predicting the results of the English Premier League. Using feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, we create a feature set for determining the most important factors for predicting the results of a football match, and consequently create a highly accurate predictive system using machine learning. We demonstrate the strong dependence of our models’ performances on important features. Our best model using gradient boosting achieved a performance of 0.2156 on the ranked probability score (RPS) metric for game weeks 6 to 38 for the English Premier League aggregated over two seasons (2014–2015 and 2015–2016), whereas the betting organizations that we consider (Bet365 and Pinnacle Sports) obtained an RPS value of 0.2012 for the same period. Since a lower RPS value represents a higher predictive accuracy, our model was not able to outperform the bookmaker’s predictions, despite obtaining promising results.",

By doing so we give a baseline for the prediction accuracy that can be achieved exploiting both statistical match data and contextual articles from human sports journalists. Our dataset is focuses on a representative time-period over 6 seasons of the English Premier League, and includes newspaper match previews from The Guardian. The models presented in this paper achieve an accuracy of 63.18% showing a 6.9% boost on the traditional statistical methods.",

      "abstract": "The sports domain presents a number of significant computational challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In this paper, we explore the techniques that have been applied to the challenges within team sports thus far. We focus on a number of different areas, namely match outcome prediction, tactical decision making, player investments, fantasy sports, and injury prediction. By assessing the work in these areas, we explore how AI is used to predict match outcomes and to help sports teams improve their strategic and tactical decision making. In particular, we describe the main directions in which research efforts have been focused to date. This highlights not only a number of strengths but also weaknesses of the models and techniques that have been employed. Finally, we discuss the research questions that exist in order to further the use of AI and ML in team sports.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents a model for forecasting association football scores. The model uses a Weibull inter-arrival-times-based count process and a copula to produce a bivariate distribution of the numbers of goals scored by the home and away teams in a match. We test it against a variety of alternatives, including the simpler Poisson distribution-based model and an independent version of our model. The out-of-sample performance of our methodology is illustrated using, first, calibration curves, then a Kelly-type betting strategy that is applied to the pre-match win/draw/loss market and to the over–under 2.5 goals market. The new model provides an improved fit to the data relative to previous models, and results in positive returns to betting.",

      "abstract": "Previous authors have rejected the Poisson model for association football scores in favour of the Negative Binomial. This paper, however, investigates the Poisson model further. Parameters representing the teams' inherent attacking and defensive strengths are incorporated and the most appropriate model is found from a hierarchy of models. Observed and expected frequencies of scores are compared and goodness-of-fit tests show that although there are some small systematic differences, an independent Poisson model gives a reasonably accurate description of football scores. Improvements can be achieved by the use of a bivariate Poisson model with a correlation between scores of 0.2.",

      "abstract": "Can the sentiment contained in tweets serve as a meaningful proxy to predict match outcomes and if so, can the magnitude of outcomes be predicted based on a degree of sentiment? To answer these questions we constructed the CentralSport system to gather tweets related to the twenty clubs of the English Premier League and analyze their sentiment content, not only to predict match outcomes, but also to use as a wagering decision system. From our analysis, tweet sentiment outperformed wagering on odds-favorites, with higher payout returns (best $2704.63 versus odds-only $1887.88) but lower accuracy, a trade-off from non-favorite wagering. This result may suggest a performance degradation that arises from conservatism in the odds-setting process, especially when three match results are possible outcomes. We found that leveraging a positive tweet sentiment surge over club average could net a payout of $3011.20. Lastly, we found that as the magnitude of positive sentiment between two clubs increased, so too did the point spread; 0.42 goal difference for clubs with a slight positive edge versus 0.90 goal difference for an overwhelming difference in positive sentiment. In both these cases, the cultural expectancy of positive tweet dominance within the twitter-base may be realistic. These outcomes may suggest that professional odds-making excessively predicts non-positive match outcomes and tighter goal spreads. These results demonstrate the power of hidden information contained within tweet sentiment and has predictive implications on the design of automated wagering systems.",
